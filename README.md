# `erltf`

> Create and interpret information encoded with the [Erlang External Term Format][erlang-ext-tf].

This module is intended for communication specifically with the [Discord Gateway][discord-gateway],
usage outside this purpose is not within the scope of this library.

> **Note**
> Full functionality in accordance with the [Erlang External Term Format][erlang-ext-tf] is not off
> the table, and we will accept contributions that provide this functionality *without hindering
> **erltf**'s ability to communicate with* the [Discord Gateway][discord-gateway].

---

> In the event we do support the entire format, we will likely re-brand this module as a
> general-purpose [Erlang External Term Format][erlang-ext-tf] library. It is only currently
> advertised as having a specific purpose as to not lead those looking for a general implementation
> astray.
